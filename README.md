[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2.1/gh/intro-stat-learning/ISLP_labs/v2_devel)


Up-to-date version of labs for ISLP.

This repo will track labs for ISLP as their source code changes.  The
intent is that building a conda environment with
`requirements.txt` will reproduce the results in this repo.

To install the current version of the requirements run

```
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-stat-learning/ISLP_labs/v2.1/requirements.txt;
```

The labs can now be run from this directory:

```
jupyter lab Ch02-statlearning-lab.ipynb
```
